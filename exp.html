                     a) Data in a 2-3 tree is stored in unsorted manner<br>
                     b) Data in a 2-3 tree is stored in a sorted manner<br>
                     c) There is no ordering among data items in a 2-3 tree<br>

                     <br>Ans. b<br>
                     Explanation : Data items in a 2-3 tree are stored in a sorted manner. The left subtree has data items smaller than the root, the middle subtree has data item greater than root and smaller than right subtree and the right subtree has data items greater than left and middle subtree.

                        Searching for an item in a 2–3 tree is similar to searching for an item in a binary search tree. Since the data elements in each node are ordered, a search function will be directed to the correct subtree and eventually to the correct node which contains the item.

                        Insertion in a 2-3 tree is very different from a Binary Search Tree as in a 2-3 tree, a node can have one data item (2-Node) or two data items (3-Node). At first, we search for the correct position of the new data element to be inserted into the tree. Once, we have found the postion of the new data element, one of the two conditions arise:<br>
                     <ul>
                        <li>The data element is to be inserted as a new node. In this case, we simply create a new node and insert the data element.</li>
                        <li>In another case, the new data element is to be inserted in an already full node. Here, full node means a node which cannot accomodate any new element. This results in <b>splitting</b> of the node</li>

                        Deletion in a 2-3 is again different from that of a Binary Search tree. Recall that, in a 2-3 tree there are two types of nodes viz., 2-Node and 3-Node. When we delete a data element from the node of a 2-3 tree, it might lead to the property of the tree being violated.<br>
                        In order to maintain the property of a 2-3 tree even after deletion of a data element, we perform various operations such as <b>merge</b>, <b>split</b> and <b>redistribution</b> of elements in the tree.

To correct this, we perform redistribution and merging of elements in the node such that the property is preserved.
